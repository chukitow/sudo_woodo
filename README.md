# Woodo

If you are a pokemon fan, you might like this
small script written:

```bash
$ npm install -g woodo
```

Then you'll be able to use it in your command line like so:

```bash

$ woodo
It's a weird tree

$ sudo woodo
     _              __
    / `\  (~._    ./  )
    \__/ __`-_\__/ ./
   _ \ \/  \   \ |_   __
 (   )  \__/ -^    \ /  \
  \_/ "  \  | o  o  |.. /  __
       \. --' ====  /  || /  \
         \   .  .  |---__.\__/
         /  :     /   |   |
         /   :   /     \_/
      --/ ::    (
     (  |     (  (____
   .--  .. ----**.____)
   \___/

```

Thanks to [TheNaox](https://github.com/TheNaoX/woodo/) for the original Go lang script.
